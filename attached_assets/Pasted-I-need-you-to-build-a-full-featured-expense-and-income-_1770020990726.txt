I need you to build a full-featured expense and income tracking web application. I already have the backend (Supabase) and automation workflows (N8N) set up and ready to use. Make sure of using Rupiah for the money!

## Technical Requirements:

### Supabase Integration:
```javascript
// Initialize Supabase client
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
)

// Example: Fetch transactions
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .select('*, categories(*), payment_methods(*)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .order('transaction_date', { ascending: false })

// Example: Add transaction
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .insert({
    user_id: user.id,
    type: 'expense',
    amount: 50.00,
    category_id: categoryId,
    description: 'Lunch'
  })

// Example: Upload receipt
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('transaction-attachments')
  .upload(`${user.id}/${fileName}`, file)
```

### N8N Webhook Integration:
```javascript
// After uploading receipt, call OCR webhook
const response = await fetch(N8N_OCR_WEBHOOK_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    user_id: user.id,
    transaction_id: transactionId,
    file_url: fileUrl,
    file_type: file.type
  })
})

const ocrData = await response.json()
// Use ocrData to pre-fill transaction form
```

### Authentication Flow:
```javascript
// Sign up
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: email,
  password: password
})

// Sign in
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: email,
  password: password
})

// Get current user
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

// Sign out
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
```

## Design Requirements:

### Style:
- Modern, clean design
- Dark theme preferred (or toggle between light/dark)
- Use beautiful color gradients for accents
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Colors Suggested:
- Primary (Yellow)	#F5F749	Your core brand color. Used for headings and primary buttons.
- Secondary (Gold)	#D9BC00	A slightly deeper yellow for hover states and secondary icons.
- Accent (Cyan)	#4ECDC4	Retained from your previous set to provide high-contrast "pop."
- Neutral Dark	#0a0a0a	Deepest background for dark mode.
- Neutral Light	#F8F9FA	Off-white for light mode background.

### Typography:
- Use modern, readable fonts
- Monospace for numbers/amounts (like Space Mono)
- Sans-serif for body text (like Sora, Inter, or similar)

### Components:
- Beautiful cards with subtle shadows and borders
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Smooth progress bars for budgets and goals
- Interactive charts (use Recharts or Chart.js)
- Loading states for async operations
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Modal dialogs for forms

### Icons:
- Use Lucide React or similar icon library
- Consistent icon style throughout

## Important Notes:

1. **Row Level Security**: All Supabase queries automatically filter by authenticated user due to RLS policies - you don't need to manually filter by user_id in SELECT queries
2. **Real-time Updates**: Consider using Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
3. **Error Handling**: Show user-friendly error messages
4. **Loading States**: Show skeletons or spinners while data loads
5. **Form Validation**: Validate all inputs before submission
6. **Responsive**: Must work perfectly on mobile devices
7. **Performance**: Optimize queries, use pagination for large lists
8. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines

## Database Tables You'll Use:

Main tables (with RLS enabled):
- `user_profiles` - user info
- `transactions` - all income/expenses
- `categories` - transaction categories
- `budgets` - budget limits
- `financial_goals` - savings goals
- `transaction_splits` - split bill details
- `split_participants` - people involved in splits
- `recurring_transactions` - recurring entries
- `income_split_rules` - auto allocation rules
- `income_split_allocations` - allocation percentages
- `payment_methods` - payment types
- `notifications` - user notifications
- `transaction_tags` - custom tags
- `user_preferences` - user settings

## Example User Flow:

1. User signs up/logs in
2. Sees dashboard with current financial status
3. Takes photo of grocery receipt
4. Clicks "Add Transaction"
5. Uploads photo - AI extracts amount, date, vendor automatically
6. User confirms details, selects category
7. Optionally marks as split with roommate
8. Saves transaction
9. Dashboard updates showing new expense
10. Budget alert shows if approaching limit
11. User checks goals page - sees progress toward vacation fund

## What I Need:

Build this as a complete, production-ready React web application that I can deploy to my VPS. Make it beautiful, functional, and user-friendly. The backend is ready - you just need to connect to it and create an amazing user experience!

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=[paste your URL]
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[paste your key]
VITE_N8N_OCR_WEBHOOK=[paste your webhook]
